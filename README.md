# Smart Wheel Junior Design

## Overview
For this project, we were given a 3 week timeframe to build a project from a wireframe to a final design. The project needed to use any software or hardware concepts learned during the semester. I worked with one computer engineering student and we showcased our smart wheel for this design project.

## Abstract
Smart Wheel project is an initiative to create awareness to distracted driving and reduce the harmful activity. Modifying current technology on a vehicle, such as the steering wheel, would reduce the amount of distracted driving incidents. The system consists of a robotic car controlled by a steering wheel controller. The wheel is built with a camera for face detection. If a face is present, the driver is able to move the vehicle remotely; otherwise, the vehicle is immobile.
